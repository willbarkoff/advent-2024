# Advent of Code

in many languages

- [Day 1](./day01/) in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
- [Day 2](./day02/) in [x86 Assembly](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/671200), which passed all of my test cases, but failed the actual ones, and it was getting late, so I fell back to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Day 3](./day03) in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Day 4](./day04) in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Day 5](./day05) in [Go](https://golang.org)
- [Day 6](./day06) in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
- [Day 7](./day07) in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Day 8](./day08) in [Swift](https://swift.org)
